    int timeout = 30)
```

| parameter | description |

| VRdevice | The Device you added earlier (unused for now) |
| position | Value of the Vector3 event |
| orientation | Orientation. |
| index | 0= HMD, 1= Right, 2 = Left |
| timeout | The timeout in seconds to wait for a response that the request was processed by the GameDriver agent. |

## Return Value

TRUE if the GameDriver agent successfully processed the request.
